# TadJobs In Summary

TadJobs is, as the name suggests, a job board. A niche job board that focusses on tech jobs. This web application offers Hiring Manangers and/or Recruiters an ability to manage multiple companies at the same. The max number of companies per user is ten!

## Admin

- So far, only recruiters are allowed to register and manage companies and jobs
- Many recruitment agencies represent different clients; with this app you do not need to create multiple users for your clients

- The jobs have external links where you can apply for the job directly (we do not support applying on the platform at the momemt)
